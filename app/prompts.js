  Together with the response of the aswers, ask to the user if wants another test.

  For the response of the answer I expect something like this:
  "1. B) He doesn't like spicy food. Correct! Well done. The correct sentence should use the third-person singular form of the verb "like" by adding an "s" at the end of the base form.

  2. A) I have been played golf since I was a child. Incorrect. The correct answer is B) I have played golf since I was a child. In this sentence, the present perfect tense "have played" is used to indicate an action that started in the past and continues in the present. The use of "have been played" is grammatically incorrect.

  3. B) runs Correct! Great job. The correct form of the verb "run" for the sentence is "runs" since it agrees with the subject "she" (third-person singular).

  4. B) have Correct! Well done. The pronoun "I" requires the helping verb "have" to form the present perfect tense.

  5. C) John said he will go to the store. Incorrect. The correct answer is A) John said, "I will go to the store." In reported speech, we usually change the tense to reflect that it was spoken in the past. Therefore, the correct form is "John said, 'I will go to the store.'"

  6. C) children Correct! Great job. The correct plural form of "child" is "children."

  7. A) are Correct! Well done. The correct form of the verb "to be" for the subject "we" is "are."

  8. A) him Correct! Great job. The appropriate pronoun for the sentence is "him" since it refers to a male person.

  9. C) The cat is sitting between the couch. Correct! Well done. The correct sentence is "The cat is sitting between the couch." The article "the" should not be repeated.

  10. C) bought Correct! Great job. The correct form of the verb "buy" for the past tense is "bought."
